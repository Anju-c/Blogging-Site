ðŸ“„ Blogsite â€“ Real-Time Blogging Platform
Tech Stack: React, CSS, Node.js, WebSocket, Prisma, PostgreSQL

I developed a dynamic blogging platform that allows users to write blog posts and engage in real-time discussions through threaded replies. The backend is built with Node.js and Prisma ORM, connected to a PostgreSQL database for relational data storage. I implemented WebSocket integration to enable live comment updates â€” replies appear instantly to all readers without needing to refresh the page. The app features RESTful APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blogs. I also added user authentication and access control to manage who can post and comment. The UI is responsive and interactive, built using React and styled with CSS.
